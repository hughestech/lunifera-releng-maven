            <question>Sample project doesn't work.  Why does sample
                project suck?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    We resent that question.  Sample wasn't designed to work, it was
                    designed to show you how to use Maven.   If you really think
                    this project sucks, then keep it to yourself.   We're not
                    interested in your pestering questions.

        <faq id="sample-project-source">
            <question>I want to put some code in Sample Project,
                how do I do this?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    If you want to add code to this project, just start putting
                    Java source in src/main/java.   If you want to put some source
                    code in this FAQ, use the source element:
                </p>
                <source>
                    system.out();
                    
                </source>

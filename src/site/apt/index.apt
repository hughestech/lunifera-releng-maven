 Welcome to the Lunifera Project, we hope you enjoy your time
on this project site.  We've tried to assemble some
great user documentation and developer information, and
we're really excited that you've taken the time to visit
this site.

--- What is Lunifera

 Well, it's easy enough to explain.   This sample project is
a sample of a project with a Maven-generated site from
Maven: The Definitive   Guide.   A dedicated team of volunteers
help maintain this sample site, and so on and so forth.
